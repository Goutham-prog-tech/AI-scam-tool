# AI Scam Awareness Tool

A bilingual (English / Telugu) web app that checks a suspicious message (typed, pasted, or read from screenshots) and shows which common scam warning signs it contains, why they are dangerous, and what to do next. It never says "100% scam": it reports *potential scam indicators* because no classifier is perfect.

## Features
- Weighted rule engine (English, Telugu, Hindi/Hinglish) + machine-learning score (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
- Messages up to 5000 characters; screenshots are read on the user's own device (OCR) and never uploaded
- Risk meter, reasons, recommended actions, and the national Cyber Crime Helpline (1930, cybercrime.gov.in)
- Voice assistant (English / Telugu / Hindi, male or female voice) that reads the warning aloud
- Language chooser, light / dark / high-contrast themes, text-size settings, 3D visual effects
- Security: strict Content-Security-Policy, security headers, rate limiting, input validation
